# Sticker Sales Forecasting with Modal and BentoML

In January 2025, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e1/overview) ran a playground series competition to forecast mulitple years worth of sticker sales in different countries. For each id row, you have to predict the num_sold which represents the number of sticker sold.

This notebook demonstrates how to build and deploy a machine learning solution for forecasting sticker sales using Modal (for serverless compute) and BentoML (for model management).
